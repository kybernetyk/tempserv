ZE TEMPERATURE SERVANT
	A temperature logging thingy for the Raspberry Pi. Uses a DS18B20 temperature sensor (via a USB testing device) to take readings every 15 minutes and saves it into a sqlite3 database. Scripts to generate ugly plots with GNUplot are provided.

	Scripts for temperature and time display via a "dream cheeky LED display" are also provided.

	Though this is intended to run 24/7 on a Raspberry Pi it will compile and run on any Linux and on OS X.

Dependencies:
	- clang (or gcc) in some newer incarnation (gcc-4.8+ needed on rpi to compile!)
	- hidapi ( https://github.com/signal11/hidapi )
	- sqlite3
	- cmake

Build & Run:
	1. download, build and install hidapi from https://github.com/signal11/hidapi
	2. do cmake magic (mkdir build; cd buil; cmake ..)
	3. create database with sqlite temp.db < schema.sql 
	4. run with runloop.sh in a screen/tmux session for fake daemoning
	5. alternatively cronjob cjob.sh (every 15 minutes)
